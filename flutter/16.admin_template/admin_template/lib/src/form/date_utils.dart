/// localized for United States English appears as:
///
/// ```
/// S M T W T F S
/// _ _ _ _ _ 1 2
/// ```

/// The offset for the first day of the months is the number of leading blanks
/// in the calendar, i.e. 5.

/// because the first day of week is Monday rather than Sunday:
///
/// ```
/// M T W T F S S
/// _ _ _ _ 1 2 3
/// ```

///   falling on Monday.

///   into the [MaterialLocalizations.narrowWeekdays] list.
/// - [MaterialLocalizations.narrowWeekdays] list provides localized names of
///   days of week, always starting with Sunday and ending with Saturday.
